# Assigning access
{: #access}

You can control access to the {{site.data.keyword.datashield_full}} Enclave Manager. This type of access control is separate from the typical Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that you use when you are working with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}


## Assigning cluster access
{: #access-cluster}

Before you can sign in to the Enclave Manager, you must have access to the cluster that the Enclave Manager is running on.
{: shortdesc}

1. Sign in to the account that hosts the cluster that you want to sign in to.

2. Go to **Manage > Access (IAM) > Users**.

3. Click **Invite users**.

4. Provide the email addresses for the user's that you want to add.

5. From the **Assign access to** drop down, select **Resource**.

6. From the **Services** drop down, select **Kubernetes Service**.

7. Select a **Region**, **Cluster**, and **Namespace**.

8. Using the Kubernetes Service documentation on [assigning cluster access](/docs/containers?topic=containers-users) as a guide, assign the access that the user needs to complete their tasks.

9. Click **Save**.

## Setting roles for Enclave Manager users
{: #enclave-roles}

{{site.data.keyword.datashield_short}} administration takes place in the Enclave Manager. As an administrator, you are automatically assigned the *manager* role, but you can also assign roles to other users.
{: shortdesc}

Check out the following table to see which roles are supported and some example actions that can be taken by each user:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Role</th>
    <th>Actions</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reader</td>
    <td>Can perform read-only actions such as viewing nodes, builds, user information, apps, tasks, and audit logs.</td>
    <td>Downloading a node attestation certificate.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Writer</td>
    <td>Can perform the actions that a Reader can perform and more; including deactivating and renewing node attestation, adding a build, and approving or denying any action or tasks.</td>
    <td>Certifying an application.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Manager</td>
    <td>Can perform the actions that a Writer can perform and more; including updating usernames and roles, adding users to the cluster, updating cluster settings, and any other privileged actions.</td>
    <td>Updating a user role.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
